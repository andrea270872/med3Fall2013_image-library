med3Fall2013_image-library
==========================

This is a work-in-progress, simple class to work wiht grayscale images in python.
It is created by the code provided by the semester 3 medialogy students from Esbjerg (DK).
The images are saved and loaded in PGM, in text format, so that they are simple to edit with a text editor as well as
to visualized with any image processing application.

More functions will be added during the semester, and at the end the class will work as a simple version of OpenCV, 
but with all the code readable and easily to modify (for other students/interested people).

Sincerely,
   Andrea Valente
